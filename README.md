# Code Quiz

## Description

This project is an interactive multiple choice quiz. The user must answer multiple choice questions relating to coding before the timer runs out. For each incorrect answer, there is a time penalty. The user's final score is equal to the remaining time. The faster you are, the better your score!

After either the timer runs out, or the user has answered all the questions, they have the opportunity to add their initials to be tracked on the leaderboard. Their initials are saved along with their score to local storage. 

After adding their initials, the user is taken to the leaderboard page, which shows the top ten scores and their corresponding initials. 

This project was an excercise in editing the DOM via JavaScript, saving to local storage, controlling the flow of a game, and ensuring the HTML is responsive to a variety of screen sizes.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
